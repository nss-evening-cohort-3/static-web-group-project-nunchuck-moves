<h1>About Farmer Ted's Soups</h1>

  <div id="story">
    <h2>Our story</h2>
      <p>When Theodore Humphrey came to the great state of North Carolina in the early 1900's, all he wanted to do was start a farm and provide a good home for his family of five. Theodore was able to do just that and became a legend before his time, by choosing to oversee his farm in the most natural way possible: never sucumbing to the scorge of chemical pesticides, carefully keeping bees to properly enhance his crops, using regimented crop-sharing techniques to make sure the soil stayed productive and even persuaded all of his farm hands to use a composting toliet to provide the farm with the best fertilization possible.

    <h2>Our mission</h2>
      <p>We began making soup in 1943 using the ways of Grandpa Theodore, our beloved Farmer Ted and strive to provide you with the most delicous, healthy and heart-warming soup you will ever taste. We use and raise only wholesome, Oregon-certified organic, plant-based ingredients and you can rest assured that all of the animal products we use in Farmer Ted's Soups are farm-raised and have not been treated with antibiotics or hormones. We work diligently with our partner-farmers to make sure we all keep the highest standards to provide you and yours with a hearty yet wholesome bowl of pure goodness.
