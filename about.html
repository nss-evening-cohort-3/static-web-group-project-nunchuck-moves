    <h2>Our story</h2>
      <p>When Theodore Humphrey came to the great state of Tennessee in the early 1900's, all he wanted to do was start a farm and provide a good home for his family of five. Theodore was able to do just that and became a legend before his time, by choosing to oversee his farm in the most natural way possible - never sucumbing to the scorge of chemical pesticides, carefully keeping bees to properly enhance his crops, using complicated crop-sharing techniques to make sure the dirt never wore out and even persuading all of his farm hands to use a composting toliet to provide the best fertilization possible.
